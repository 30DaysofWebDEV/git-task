## Chaitanya Nitin Pawar
### A computer science student passionate about programming and design.
#### My name is Chaitanya Pawar. I'm an Bachelor's student at KKWIEER Computer Science Department. I was born and raised in Nashik. I did HSC D.D. Bytco Boys High-School, Pune University. Also I am pursuing BA from Panchavati College, YCM open university. I like to travel and photograph. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.

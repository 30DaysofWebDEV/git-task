#About me
My name is Rajnish Pandey

I come from Bihar, ancient name Magadha.

Bihar was known as Magadha in ancient times. It was a center of power, learning and culture. The Maurya empire as well as one of the world's greatest pacifist religions, Buddhism, arose from Magadha. Bihari empires, like the Maurya and the Gupta, unified large parts of South Asia under a central rule.

I am interested in Python and Web Technology

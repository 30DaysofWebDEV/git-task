### Name:
Chandan Raj
### About:
Building a piece of technology is analogous to making a living thing. The architecture is the skeleton, the code is the mass, front-end is the skin. Together, they make something beautiful, something to admire. And this feeling of bringing something to life is what keeps me motivated.

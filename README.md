My name is Aditya Gupta, Passion and diligence are two traits that I believe most reflect me as an individual. It is my belief that this is the key to being successful in any endeavor that one sets their mind. I love to generate new ideas and devise feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. I enjoy embracing the lessons learned from failure, stand up, and continue to grow.
